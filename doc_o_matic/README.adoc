## Doc-o-matic (5000)

Good, readable, documentation is key. But we want
to have historical docs and API docs and all manner of
docs.

Doc-o-matic aims to solve this issue by generating documentation
 across all of [Funcation's](https://funcatron.org) sub-projects,
 by tag, so there's a full corpus of documentation with stable URLs.

Basically, it's a Docker file that looks across all the Funcatron
 projects and builds documentation for everything, tars it up,
 and delivers it... or at least, that's the theory.

### Important Files

* `Dockerfile` -- defines the environment to run _doc-o-matic_ in
* `build-docs.sh` -- builds the Docker image and then runs the image to produce the docs... in `../../doc.tgz`
* `doc_it.py` -- the Python script that looks across all the tags for all the Funcatron projects and
  runs the appropriate documentation builders for each.
* `front_master.adoc` --

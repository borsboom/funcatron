# Doc-o-matic (5000)

Good, readable, documentation is key. But we want
to have historical docs and API docs and all manner of
docs.

Doc-o-matic aims to solve this issue by generating documentation
 across all of [Funcation's](https://funcatron.org) sub-projects,
 by tag, so there's a full corpus of documentation with stable URLs.

 Basically, it's a Docker file that looks across all the Funcatron
 projects and builds documentation for everything, tars it up,
 and delivers it... or at least, that's the theory.
